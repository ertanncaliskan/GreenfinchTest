This solution is very basic "video watching website" for showing my skills on Greenfinch test's requirements.

It has own session layer, CacheDictionary
It has own authorization filter, GreenFinchAuthorizationFilter
It has abstracted orm library, I used NPoco for that solution but you can implement whatever you want under AbstractedORMLibrary project. You don't need to change any soucecodes under GreenfinchTest project.
It has own business logic layer, UserActionBL

for making debug on your IDE,
* you need to execute CreateDatabase.sql on your Microsoft SQL Management Studio.
* you need to change connection string ConnectionStringProvider class' GetConnectionString property.
